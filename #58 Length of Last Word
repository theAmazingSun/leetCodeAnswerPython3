Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        local_count, count = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == ' ':
                local_count = 0
            else:
                local_count += 1
                count = local_count
        return count
